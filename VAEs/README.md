# Purpose

- The purpose of this section is to explore the **Autoencoder** model with its variations.

- The purpose is to see how the results are improved by passing from a simple autoencoder to a variational autoencoder, where the latent space is structured by using **multivariate gaussian distributions** instead of just points in the space.

- The other complexity I wanna see, is how the outputs change when you vary the dimension of the **latent space**. 

- For this purpose I'm gonna use the dataset cifar100, which can be downloaded using tensorflow.
